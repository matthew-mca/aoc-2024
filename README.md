# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my attempt at Advent of Code 2024.

This year, I decided to try and use AoC to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Given that Rust contains a lot of
novel concepts and can be very strict/verbose, I opted to only go as far as Day 9. I found that part 2 of day 9 was the
first instance of the challenge where I spent a huge amount of time working on a problem and still could not find the
correct answer, so it felt sensible to stop there for the year. I still learned an awful lot about the Rust language in
that time, and I'm glad that I chose to try this year's challenges with it!

Below is a quick summary of the various days and how far I got, to save someone trying to figure it out from the source
code:

- **Day 1:** Completed
- **Day 2:** Completed
- **Day 3:** Completed
- **Day 4:** Completed
- **Day 5:** Got an implementation that correctly solves the example, but not the full challenge input.
- **Day 6:** Completed part 1
- **Day 7:** Completed
- **Day 8:** Skipped
- **Day 9:** Completed part 1. Part 2 implementation can solve the example, but not the full challenge input.
